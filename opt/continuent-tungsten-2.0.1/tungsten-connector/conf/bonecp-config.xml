             Setting this to 5 with 3 partitions means you will have 15 unique 
             connections to the database. Note that the connection pool will not
             create all these connections in one go but rather start off with 
             minConnectionsPerPartition and gradually increase connections as
             required. -->

             batches. This property controls how many new connections to create 
             in one go (up to a maximum of maxConnectionsPerPartition).

        <!-- Sets number of partitions to use.  In order to reduce lock 
             contention and thus improve performance, each incoming connection 
             request picks off a connection from a pool that has 
             thread-affinity, i.e. pool[threadId % partition_count]. 
             The higher this number, the better your performance will be for the 
             case when you have plenty of short-lived threads. Beyond a certain 
             threshold, maintenance of these pools will start to have a negative 
             effect on performance (and only for the case when connections on a 
             partition start running out).  Default: 1, minimum: 1, recommended:
             2-4 (but very app specific) -->
