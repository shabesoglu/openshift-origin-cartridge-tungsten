# information on the user.map file and syntax
#
# User and password set here will be used for both client authentication
# to the connector and connector authentication to the data sources.  You may 
# specify lines starting with @script to indicate a command that should be 
# run.  The command should output the password lines using the format shown.
#
# Format:
#
# <user> <password> <service> [affinity]
# ...
#
# "-" (without quotes) as password field means that password is empty
# Reserved characters: (space) and (tab)
#
# Examples:
# user tungstenuser has password secret and uses 'sjc_nyc' composite 
# data service, but prefers nyc site for reading:
#   tungstenuser secret sjc_nyc nyc
#
# the affinity is optional, alice has no password and uses 
# data service 'default':
#   alice - default
#
# Run the '/opt/continuent/share/gen_user_map.sh' command and parse its 
# output as password entries.
#   @script /opt/continuent/share/gen_user_map.sh
#
# Run the '/opt/continuent/share/gen_composite_user_map.sh' command with
# 'sjc_nyc' as its first argument and parse its output as password entries.
#   @script /opt/continuent/share/gen_composite_user_map.sh sjc_nyc

# Read-only connections to slaves can be used for read requests. Beware that 
# read data can be out-dated, depending on the slave latency!
# If you don't know what you are doing, don't specify anything here.

# @direct tungstenuser

# Host option will map a hostname to a quality of service.  When a client 
# connects to the connector through the specified hostname, the given QoS will # be applied.
#
# Note that you can define several hostnames for localhost in your /etc/hosts. # Examples:
# in /etc/hosts:
#   127.0.0.1 master.localhost
#   127.0.0.2 slave.localhost
# here:
#   @hostoption master.localhost qos=RW_STRICT
#   @hostoption slave.localhost qos=RO_RELAXED
