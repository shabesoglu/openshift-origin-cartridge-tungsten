To start the connector, you first need to edit the following file:
* conf/user.map
 
You may want to add the connector bin directory to your PATH:
$ export PATH=$PATH:/opt/continuent/tungsten/tungsten-connector/bin

You can then:

$ connector start
Starts the connector as a daemon (in background)

$ connector console
Starts the connector interactively (in foreground)

$ connector stop
Stops the connector daemon

$ connector restart
Restarts the connector daemon

$ connector status
Prints the status of the connector daemon

$ connector dump
Prints a dump of the connector threads in the logs (for debugging purpose)

Log files are located in the log/ directory.
