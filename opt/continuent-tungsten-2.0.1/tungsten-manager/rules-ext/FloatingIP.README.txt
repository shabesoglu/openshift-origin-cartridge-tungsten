                  IMPLEMENTING MASTER FLOATING IP SUPPORT
                              9 January 2009

Here are basic instructions for implementing master floating IP
support in Tungsten.  We do this by adding a couple of extra rules
to each manager that run a specialized procedure whenever the master
goes on or offline.  This allows you to grab a virtual IP address
whenever a master data source goes online and drop it when the data
source goes offline.

The following instructions assume the VIP is 10.10.12.22.  This
procedure will work with any address provided the address is on the
same subnet as all hosts that may be promoted to master.

Follow the steps shown below:  

1.) Ensure that your database server is listening on all IP addresses.  If
the server listens on a single address, it will not be able to accept
connections on the VIP.  Restart your database service if any changes are
required.

For MySQL add the following line to your my.cnf file.

bind_address=0.0.0.0

For PostgreSQL add the following line to your postgresql.conf file

listen_addresses='*'

2.) Create file
cluster-home/conf/cluster/<clustername>/service/master.properties
with the following properties:

# master.properties
name=master
command.start=sudo /sbin/ifconfig eth0:0 10.10.12.22
command.stop=sudo /sbin/ifconfig eth0:0 down
command.restart=echo "Not supported"
command.status=sudo /sbin/ifconfig eth0:0

This file maps the service start command to grabbing virtual IP
address 10.10.12.22 on interface eth0:0.  The stop command drops
it.  Note that your login must support running /sbin/ifconfig using
sudo, which means that you may have to edit the sudoers file to 
set up the proper permissions for non-root accounts.  The following
example shows how to do this for the 'tungsten' account on host 
centos5a.  (Substitute login and host names accordingly for your site.) 

  a. Execute 'visudo' as root.  This brings up the /etc/sudoers file. 

  b. Add the following lines to the end of the sudoers file: 

     ## Allow 'tungsten' to run /sbin/ifconfig without a password. 
     tungsten centos5a=NOPASSWD: /sbin/ifconfig

  c. Save changes and exit.  

3.) Next copy the rules file FloatingIP.drl to the
tungsten-cluster-manager/rules directory and restart the manager.
The rules cause the coordinator to invoke the foregoing start and
stop commands when the master data source goes on- or offline.

4.) Once the manager restarts, login with cctrl.  You can now pick
up the IP address just by turning the master data source one and
offline.  To confirm, you can login to the DBMS using the virtual
IP address or run /sbin/ifconfig.

[LOGICAL] /cluster/demo/> datasource centos5a online 
DataSource 'centos5a' is now ONLINE
[LOGICAL] /cluster/demo/> datasource centos5a offline
DataSource 'centos5a' is now OFFLINE

5.) You can confirm easily that the VIP is available using the 'ifconfig' 
command, which shows all configured network interface.  For example, here
is ifconfig output when the VIP is assigned: 

$ /sbin/ifconfig eth0:0
eth0:0    Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:0C:29:96:91:55  
          inet addr:10.10.12.22  Bcast:10.255.255.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          Base address:0x2000 Memory:d8920000-d8940000 

Here is the output then the VIP is unassigned. 

$ /sbin/ifconfig eth0:0
eth0:0    Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:0C:29:96:91:55  
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          Base address:0x2000 Memory:d8920000-d8940000
