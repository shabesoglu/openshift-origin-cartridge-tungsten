# Loopback Handler Definition
#
# The loopback handler accepts any ActionEvent it receives and responds with 
# a ResponseEvent containing the action string and arguments.  This handler
# is used to test manager liveness.  The handler is available by default 
# in every service manager but must be explicitly activated.
