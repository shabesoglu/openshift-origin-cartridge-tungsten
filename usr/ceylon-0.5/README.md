# Ceylon distribution

This is the Milestone 5 "Nesa Pong" release of the Ceylon command line tools (version 
0.5). This is a pre-release version of the platform for review by the community.

Ceylon is a programming language for writing large programs in a team environment. 
The language is elegant, highly readable, extremely typesafe, and makes it easy to 
get things done. And it's easy to learn for programmers who are familiar with 
mainstream languages used in business computing. Ceylon has a full-featured 
Eclipse-based development environment, allowing developers to take best advantage 
of the powerful static type system. Programs written in Ceylon execute on any 
Java 7 compatible JVM or Node.js.

## Running the sample programs

To compile and run the samples, start from the distribution directory containing
this file.

### Sample module

To run the "hello world" program, type:

    cd samples/helloworld

For Java:

    ../../bin/ceylon compile com.example.helloworld
    ../../bin/ceylon doc --non-shared --source-code com.example.helloworld
    ../../bin/ceylon run com.example.helloworld/1.0.0 John

For JavaScript:

    ../../bin/ceylon compile-js com.example.helloworld
    ../../bin/ceylon run-js com.example.helloworld/1.0.0

### Sample with no module

To run a program defined in the default module, type:

    cd samples/no-module

For Java:

    ../../bin/ceylon compile default
    ../../bin/ceylon doc --non-shared --source-code default
    ../../bin/ceylon run default

For JavaScript:

    ../../bin/ceylon compile-js default
    ../../bin/ceylon run-js default

### Sample module with Java interoperability

To run the "Java interop" program, type:

    cd samples/interop-java
    ../../bin/ceylon compile com.example.interop
    ../../bin/ceylon doc --non-shared --source-code com.example.interop
    ../../bin/ceylon run com.example.interop/1.0.0 John

Note: this is only available for the Java backend.

## Tool usage

To see a list of command line options for a particular subcommand use the 
`help` subcommand. For example, to get help on the `compile` tool:

    ./bin/ceylon help compile

## Ant tasks for Ceylon

We include support for Ceylon ant tasks which are documented on
at <http://ceylon-lang.org/documentation/1.0/reference/tool/ant/>.

To run the "hello world" program using ant, type:

    cd samples/helloworld
    ant

## Systems where Ceylon is known to work

Since Ceylon is running on the JVM it should work on every platform that 
supports a Java 7 compatible JVM. However we have tested the following 
platforms to make sure it works:

### Linux

- Ubuntu "precise" 12.04 (64 bit) JDK 1.7.0_03 (IcedTea), 
- Fedora 17 (64 bit) JDK 1.7.0_09 (IcedTea)
- Fedora 16 (64 bit), JDK 1.7.0_b147 (IcedTea)

### Windows

- Windows 7 (64 bit) 1.7.0_05 (Oracle)
- Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 JDK 1.7.0_04

### OSX

- OSX 10 Lion (10.7.3) JDK 1.7.0_05 (Oracle)
